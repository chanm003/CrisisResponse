Getting Web Part Properties:

CODE SMELLS:
- <initiatechopbutton> contains too much code, dialog html is currently injected into <body> using jQuery, consider making this a directive, so the jquery only adds <chopDialog> into <body> then figure out some form of directive-to-directive communication mechanism.  <initiatechopbutton> might emit a chopButtonClickedEvent with (missions[], documentObj).  Then the <chopDialog> might emit a documentChopInitiated event handler with (document)

Question:
- currently clicking on one of the subway nodes launches the dialog AND potentially changes the facepiles
- should we always just fix the facepiles to the command that has the CONCH?
